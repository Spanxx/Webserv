- [ ] handle piped requests? --> adjust server loop
- [ ] handle chunked requests
- [ ] handle chunked responses
- [ ] inside config file:
	- [ ] set up default error pages (what does this mean?)
	- [ ] set max size of request body (+ implement inside read request function)
	- [ ] configure where uploaded files should be saved (+adjust makefile rule to delete that specific file, if possible?)
	- [ ] check or adjust routing to index.html when directory is requested, to serve directly with code 200 instead of 301 (list available directories or not?)
- [ ] refactor logic with exceptions instead of return values
