# üß† Thoughts 

**Before starting this project**
- [ ] read the RFC
- Version from 1999 (obsolet)
	- [RFC 2616](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc2616),  [RFC 2617](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc2617)
- Current version
	- [RFC 9110](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9110) Semantics, Content and Authentication
	- [RFC 9111](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9111) Caching
	- [RFC 9112](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc9112) Message Syntax and Routing
	
	- [RFC 7230](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7230) & [RFC 7231](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc7231) are older version, but easier to understand.
	- ‚úÖ We should use **RFC 9110** and **9112** as our main reference.  
		- (And occasionally check old 7230 examples for easier explanations.)

- [ ]  telnet and NGINX
	--> [[Testing Telnet & NGINX]]
- [ ] what is a CGI?

# Requirements

- [ ] take config file
- [ ] cannot execve another web server
- [ ] remain non-blocking at all times / handle client disconnect
- [ ] non-blocking &  onlly 1 poll() (or equivalent) for all I/O (listen included)
- [ ] poll() must monitor read and write simultaneously
- [ ] NO read or write without poll()
- [ ] Checking `errno` is striclty forbidden after read and write ‚ùó
- [ ] not required to use poll() before reading config file
- [ ] Every macro and define is allowd (like FD_SET, FD_CLR, FD_ISSET and, FD_ZERO)
	- [ ] how do they work?
- [ ] request should never hang indefinitely
- [ ] compatible with standard web browser of our choice
- [ ] consider that NGINX is HTTP 1.1 compliant and may be used to compare headers and answer behaviors ‚ùì
- [ ] accurate HTTP response status code
- [ ] default error pages (if not provided)
- [ ] can't use fork for anything other than CGI (like PHP, Python...)
- [ ] serve a fully static website
- [ ] able to upload files
- [ ] Methods: GET, POST and DELETE
- [ ] Stress test successfull
- [ ] able to listen to multiple ports (see config file)
# Executable Command

#### `./webserv [configuration file`]

# Configuration file

in file, you should be able to:
- [ ] choose port and host
- [ ] set up server name
- [ ] first server for host:port = default (responds to all requests)
- [ ] default error pages
- [ ] max size for client request bodies
- [ ] set up routes with one or multiple rules/configs (no regexp)
	- [ ] list of accepted HTTP methods for route
	- [ ] HTTP redirect
	- [ ] directory or file where requested file shold be located
		(e.g. if url /kapouet is rooted to /tmp/www, url /kapouet/pouic/toto/pouet is /tmp/www/pouic/toto/pouet)
	- [ ] enable or disable directory listening
	- [ ] set default file to server if request is directory
	- [ ] execute CGI based on file extension (e.g. .php)
	- [ ] works with POST and GET
	- [ ] allow file upload and configure where they are saved
- [ ] CGI
	- [ ] use full path as PATH_INFO
	- [ ] chunked requests needed to be unchunked / CGI expects EOF at end of body
	- [ ] same for output, if no content length is returned from CGI = EOF will mark the end
	- [ ] programm should call CGI with requested file as first argument
	- [ ] CGI should run in correct directory for relative path file access
	- [ ] server should support at least one CGI (php-CGI, Python....)

We have to provide config files and default files for testing.
# Bonus part

- [ ] support cookies and session management (provide simple examples)
- [ ] handle multiple CGI
